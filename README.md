## üì∞ How to Change The News Category 
You can change news category by modifying the **NewsAPI query** in the `main.py` script.
Open `main.py` and locate this line:
```python
category = "technology"
```
Possible categories with NewsAPI are:  `business`, `entertainment`, `general`, `health`, `science`, `sports`, and `technology`.

## FAQs‚ùì
<details>
<summary>1. Can I change the frequency of the email updates?</summary>
    Yes, just open <code>schedule.yml</code> and modify the <code>cron</code> schedule to change the timing.
    <br>
    Example for hourly runs: <code>- cron: '0 * * * *'</code>
    </br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>2. Can I use this bot with other news APIs?</summary>
    Yes, but you‚Äôll need to modify the <code>get_news()</code> function in <code>main.py</code> to make API requests to the new service and parse their response format.
</details>
<details>
<summary>3. Can I customize the email content?</summary>
    Yes, just edit the <code>get_tech_news()</code> or <code>send_email()</code> functions in <code>main.py.</code> You can change the formatting, number of articles, or add new details to the email body.
</details>
<details>
<summary>4. Can I host this on a local machine instead of GitHub Actions?</summary>
    Yes, install the required dependencies and set up a <code>cron</code> job to run <code>main.py</code> on your local machine. Use a <code>.env</code> file to manage your credentials securely.
</details>
<details>
<summary>5. How do I set up my email credentials securely?</summary>
    Store your credentials (<code>STMP_SERVER</code>,<code>NEWSAPI_KEY</code>,etc...) in GitHub Secrets as shown in the setup and configuration steps above.
    <br>
    IMPORTANT: <b>NEVER</b> hard-code any sensitive information directly in your code. 
    </br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>6. How is SMTP security handled, and is it safe to store sensitive information in GitHub Secrets? </summary>
    SMTP credentials (such as email, password, server, and port number) are stored securely in GitHub Secrets, which are encrypted and accessible only as environment variables during workflow action. You can also use this bot with an email address that you don‚Äôt frequently use (<code>SENDER_EMAIL</code>) while adding your primary email (<code>RECEIVER_EMAIL</code>) address as the recipient in GitHub Secrets. Steps for this are shown in the setup and configuration steps above. And while it may not always be necessary, I recommend using App Passwords instead of your actual email password for added protection. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>7. What are App Passwords? </summary>
    App Passwords are platform-specific passwords that allows third-party apps (like this bot) to access your email account without exposing your main account password.

<details>
<summary>8. Is it possible to use this bot with multiple recipients? </summary>
    Yes, but with some modification. First, you need to add the recipients to <code>RECEIVER_EMAIL</code> in GitHub secrets, seperated by commas. Let's say you have: example1@gmail.com, example2@gmail.com. Then you need to modify the <code>send_email</code> function in <code>main.py</code> so that it can handle multiple recipients. Now, the below line splits the <code>receiver_email</code> string (Stored in GitHub Secrets) into a list of email addresses, allowing you to handle multiple recipients.
<pre>
<code>
recipients = email_config['receiver_email'].split(",") 
</code>
</pre>
Now add a loop to send emails to each recipient individually.
<pre>
<code>
    for recipient in recipients:
    recipient = recipient.strip()  # Remove spaces
    msg['To'] = recipient
    server.send_message(msg)
    logging.info(f"Email sent to {recipient}")
</code>
</pre>
And a log message for each recipient for debugging 
<pre>
<code>
    logging.info(f"Email sent to {recipient}")
</code>
</pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>9. What if there are no articles available in the selected category?</summary>
    The bot will log a warning: <code>No articles found for category: <category></code> and skip sending the email.
</details>
<details>
<summary>10. Can I change the number of news articles in the email?</summary>
    Yes, modify the <code>[:5]</code> in the <code>get_news()</code> function to your desired number of articles. 
    <br>
    Example: <code>articles = response.json().get('articles', [])[:10]  # Gets top 10 articles</code>
    </br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>11. Can I change the email format to HTML instead of plain text?</summary>
    Yes, modify the <code>send_email()</code> function and change the email body format from plain to html.
</details>
